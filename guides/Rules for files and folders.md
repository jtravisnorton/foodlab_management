#Rules for creating lab folders:
##Projects
###Root folder naming
Folders should be named after the project they will organize and should be preceded with `Project_`.

`good example: Project_NIFA`

**Note on files in root folders:** Avoid placing files in the root folders of projects. The only files in the root folder should be those essential to the project overall - project management spreadsheets, for instance.

###Sub-folder naming
Sub-folders should be named after a defined subset of an overall project. The project manager should have a good understanding of what information is contained within each sub-folder and which person on a project team is responsible for it.

###File naming
Files should be named in a concise and desriptive way, such that others on the project team can tell the purpose of a file
